This tool Helps check the Security Posture of your system.
The thing you have to do first and formemost when downloading  the installer is to check 2 files first: 
1- The output file to download the App  
2- Read the README of the external/nmap file because you will definitely need this for Nmap.
Good Luck and Good Auditing!
